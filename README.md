# Goal

The goal of this app is to practise Domain-Driven Design(DDD) by implementing simple Rails application.

I treat this project as a place where I can experiment and practice different DDD approaches and patterns.
Most of the patterns are from Eric Evans blue book (Domain-Driven Design, tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software).

While working on the project I'm documenting my thoughts and design decisions in `/notes` dir.

# Domain

Business domain of the project is aero club management.
